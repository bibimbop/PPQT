 PPQT is written in Python (2.7 but should require little to make it 3)
 with PyQt4 and Qt4.

 A single document file, bookname.suffix, is edited. A variety of metadata
 is collected the first time a file is opened and is saved in a metadata file,
 bookname.suffix.metadata. Also expected to exist at the same file path
 as bookname.suffix:
     bookname.suffix.meta (created on first save)
     good_words.txt (optional)
     bad_words.txt (optional)
     pngs, a folder containing page scan images named nnn.png

 The main window has two panes divided by a splitter. The left pane has
 the text for editing (QPlainTextEdit). Besides the usual editing functions
 PPQT supports highlighting words from a file of common "scannos," and also
 underlining of words that fail the built-in spellcheck.
 
 The right pane is a Qt Tabset with several panels for specific functions:

    Pngs :  Shows the scan image (nnn.png) for the text at the insertion point
	    from the pngs folder.

    Find :  A variety of search/replace controls including predefined regex
            searches in a user-programmable button array.

    Notes : A QPlainTextEdit where the user can keep notes that are saved as
	    part of the metadata.

    Pages : A table of all pages with their scan (.png) numbers, folio
            (pagination) controls, and proofer ids. Page boundaries are kept
	    in the metadata after page delimiters are purged.

    Chars : A table of the character census, showing for each its glyph,
	    hex value, count of occurrences, HTML Entity code,
	    and Unicode class, sortable on any column. Filterable to show
	    non-Ascii and non-Latin-1.

    Words : A table of the word census, showing for each its text, count
            of occurrences, and properties (all-cap, fails spellcheck, etc),
	    sortable by text and count, and filterable on properties.

    Flow :  Controls for Ascii text reflow, Ascii table processing, and
	    and HTML auto-conversion.

    View :  Displays the document as rendered by QWebView.

    FNote(TBS) : Controls related to footnote processing and a table of the
	    footnotes found, with errors indicated.
    
    Help :   Terse documentation of all features

PPQT incorporates a spellcheck system based on Myspell/OpenOffice dictionaries
but implemented in Python code (to avoid having to include pyCharm or such).
Besides one default dictionary for the document, it allows phrases or sections
to be marked off to be spellchecked using a different language.
