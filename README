Introducing PPQT
================

PPQT (Post-processing in Python and Qt) is an integrated application meant to assist the volunteers who post-process etexts prepared at Distributed Proofreaders (PGDP.net). It provides a text editor that integrates a number of features useful during post-processing, including display of the book's scanned pages, regular expression find/replace, spellcheck, pagination, footnoting, and html preview.

Features
---------

A single document file, _bookname_._suffix_, is edited. A variety of metadata is collected the first time a file is opened, and thereafter is saved in a metadata file, _bookname_._suffix_.meta. Also expected to exist at the same file path as bookname.suffix:
 
-    bookname.suffix.meta (created on first save)
-    good_words.txt (optional)
-    bad_words.txt (optional)
-    pngs, a folder containing page scan images named (typically) nnn.png

The main window has two panes divided by a splitter. The left pane is a plain-text editor where the file is edited. Besides the usual editing functions PPQT supports highlighting words from a file of common "scannos," and also underlining of words that have failed the built-in spellcheck.
 
The right pane is a tabset with tabs for panels for specific functions:

    Pngs :  Shows the scan image (nnn.png) from the pngs folder matching the text at the insertion point.

    Notes : A simple editor where the user can keep notes that are saved as part of the metadata.

    Find :  A variety of search/replace controls including predefined regex searches in a user-programmable button array.

    Chars : A table with a row for each character in the document, showing the glyph, hex value, count of occurrences, HTML Entity code, Unicode class and Unicode name, sortable on any column. Filterable to show only non-Ascii and non-Latin-1 characters.

    Words : A table with a row for each unique word in the document, showing for each its text, count of occurrences, and properties (all-cap, fails spellcheck, etc), sortable by text and count, and filterable on properties.

    Flow :  Controls for Ascii text reflow, Ascii table processing, and for HTML auto-conversion.

    Pages : A table of all pages with their scan (.png) numbers, folio (pagination) controls, and proofer ids. Page boundaries are kept in the metadata after page delimiter lines are purged.

    FNote : A table of all footnotes in the document, with controls for renumbering and moving footnotes and HTML conversion.

    Pvw :  Displays the document as rendered by a browser (webkit).
    
    Help :   Terse documentation of all features

PPQT incorporates a spellcheck using Hunspell and Myspell/OpenOffice dictionaries. Besides one default dictionary for the document, it allows phrases or sections to be marked off to be spellchecked using a different language.
