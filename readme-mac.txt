PPQT uses the Qt cross-platform application and UI framework (qt-project.org).

PyQt4 is licensed or nonprofit use under the GPL2 and GPL3.

PPQT is packaged using pyinstaller (pyinstaller.org) which is also

== INSTALLATION ==

Drag the folder PPQT to any convenient location. If you have a 
folder dedicated to PGDP Post-Processing, that would be the best place.

Within the PPQT folder locate the file ppqt (lowercase). This is the 
executable program. It must launch within the PPQT folder which contains
all its support code. For convenience, control-click on the ppqt file
and from the context menu, select "Make Alias". Drag the resulting alias
file onto your desktop. You can launch PPQT by double-clicking this alias.

This completes the installation process.

== DOCUMENTATION ==

Launch PPQT, which displays a window with an edit panel on the left
and a set of tabs on the right. Click the tab marked Help to reveal
the Help panel. This constitutes the documentation for PPQT. Read it.
Really. Everything the program does is in there. Read it now.

== MAINTENANCE ==

From time to time new versions of PPQT may be released. Usually it
will not be necessary to download the entire PPQT folder zip file.
Instead you may download just a new ppqt executable to replace the
one in the PPQT folder.
