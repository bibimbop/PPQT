<h1>PPQT Information</h1>
<p>PPQT is a tool for post-processing books for Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders. PPQT is based on Qt by Nokia (qt.nokia.com). It is coded in Python using PQt4 (riverbankcomputing.co.uk). It is packaged for release using pyinstaller (pyinstaller.org).</p>
<h3>Licenses</h3>
<p>Qt is licensed for noncommercial use under the LGPL.
PyQt4 is licensed for noncommercial use under the GPL v2 and the GPL v3.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>First a deep bow of respect to Steve Shulz (Thundergnat) who created and maintained Guiguts, the program from which PPQT takes inspiration and lots of ideas. Second, a genuflection  to Mark Summerfield for the book <i>Rapid GUI Developement with PyQt</i>.</p>
<h3>Mac Users Note</h3><p> Throughout this Help, when you read <b>ctrl-</b>
you think <b>cmd-</b>. And when you read <b>alt-</b>, you think <b>opt-</b>.
Qt is quite consistent in these mappings.</p>
<p>Key ctl-f for a simple Find dialog for searching in this help text.</p>
<h2>Files and Folders</h2>
<p>PPQT edits one text file at a time; call it <i>bookname</i><b>.</b><i>sfx</i>, for example <tt>foobar.utf</tt>.
<h3>File Encodings and Suffixes</h3>
<p>PPQT is entirely Unicode internally. The text file is converted to Unicode
on input, and converted back to ascii (if necessary) on output. The type of
encoding done is based on the file suffix:</p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><td><tt>.txt</tt></td><td>Latin-1 or 7-bit Ascii (PPQT cannot distinguish between these)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>.utf</tt></td><td>UTF-8 encoding of Unicode. Use for any text with e.g. Greek characters</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>.win</tt></td><td>Windows code page 1252. Should be used only for input; save as .txt or .utf</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>.mac</tt></td><td>Mac Roman. Should be used only for input; save as .txt or .utf</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Metadata</h3>
When opening <i>bookname</i><b>.</b><i>sfx</i>, PPQT looks for a file named <i>bookname</i><b>.</b><i>sfx</i><b>.</b><tt>meta</tt>
in the same directory, for example <tt>foobar.utf.meta</tt>. If the meta file
does not exist, PPQT assumes this is the first time it has opened the file.
It scans the text gathering information including the location of page separator lines and counting words and characters. This metadata is stored in the <tt>.meta</tt> file when the file is saved. When the <tt>.meta</tt> file does
exist, PPQT loads these metadata from it.</p>
<p>It is not recommended that you examine or edit the metadata file
but if you do, be aware that it is written in UTF-8 format. If strange
characters appear, your editor app did not use the utf-encoding to load it.
Do not save the metadata file unless you are sure you can save it in UTF-8 format.</p>
<h3>Page Images</h3>
<p>PPQT expects to find a folder named <tt>pngs</tt> in the same location as
the text file, containing the scan images for the book. These are displayed in 
the Pngs panel.</p>
<h2>The Edit Panel</h2>
<p>The left-side panel is a typical modern plain text line-editor.
It uses a monospaced font, defaulting to Deja Vu Mono (dejavu-fonts.org)
or to Courier New, either of which is legible and has a full range
of Unicode characters. Select View>Font... to select a preferred font, which will be remembered from session to session.</p>
<p>Below the edit panel is a status area where activity messages appear
from time to time. Bottom center is a line-number field displaying the
line number of the edit cursor. Type a new number in
that field and press Return to jump to a different line. Further to the
right is a progress bar that shows the status of some long-running operations.</p>
<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>Select text
by dragging, or by click then shift-click, or by doubleclick (word) or 
tripleclick (line). Extend a selection by holding the shift key and
using an arrow key. Move text by dragging the selection,
or copy text by alt-dragging.</p>
<h3>Edit Keys</h3>
<ul>
<li>up/dn/left/right: move cursor</li>
<li>Home, also ctl-up: Top of text</li>
<li>End, also ctl-dn: Bottom of text</li>
<li>PgUp/PgDn: move cursor one editor screen up/dn</li>
<li>ctl-left and ctl-right: beginning and end of line</li>
<li>alt-left and alt-right: word-left, word-right</li>
<li>Add shift key to any of the above: extends selection</li>
<li>ctl-c/ctl-x/ctl-v: copy/cut/paste</li>
<li>ctl-z: undo</li>
<li>ctl-y, also shift-ctl-z: redo</li>
<li>ctl-hyphen: display text 1pt smaller</li>
<li>ctl-+: display text 1pt larger</li>
<li>ctl-f: display Find panel and put focus there</li>
<li>shift-ctl-f: copy selection to Find panel</li>
<li>ctl-g: repeat the last search forward (same as Find Next)</li>
<li>shift-ctl-g: repeat last search backward (same as Find Prior)</li>
<li>ctl-=: replace selection (same as Find panel replace #1)</li>
<li>ctl-t: replace selection and repeat find forward</li>
<li>shift-ctl-t: replace selection and repeat find backward</li>
<li>ctl-1 through ctl-9: jump to bookmark 1-9</li>
<li>shift-ctl-1 through shift-ctl-9: set bookmark 1-9 to cursor</li>
</ul>
<p>Bookmarks are saved in the metadata.</p>
<h3>Scanno Highlighting</h3>
<p>Use File > Scannos to load a file of scannos: a text file with one word per line (e.g <tt>en-common</tt> from guiguts). May be a UTF file. The same file will be re-loaded each time PPQT is restarted, if it exists.</p>
<p>Use the View > Scannos menu to turn on scanno highlighting, putting
a plum-colored background on any word that appears in the scannos file.</p>
<h3>Spellcheck</h3>
<p>PPQT looks for a file <tt>good_words.txt</tt> (or <tt>.utf</tt>) when it opens the text for the first time, and loads its contents. It looks for a file <tt>bad_words.txt</tt> (or <tt>.utf</tt>) also. These "good" and "bad" words are saved in the metadata file thereafter. More "good" words can be added from the Words panel.</p>
<p>When (re)building its metadata, PPQT checks all words for spelling. It tries to attach Aspell (version 0.60.x, the latest) as a subprocess. A "bad" word is assumed to be misspelt; a "good" word is assumed to be correct. Any word not in those lists is presented to Aspell (if it is attached), and noted as correct or misspelt.</p>
<p>Use View > Spelling to turn on red-underlining of misspelt words.</p>
<h2>Pngs Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Pngs tab. This panel displays the scan image from the <tt>pngs</tt> folder that corresponds to the present edit cursor position. When the focus is in the Pngs panel (click in it) ctl-hyphen zooms out and ctl-plus zooms in. The current zoom setting is remembered from session to session.
</p>
<h2>Notes Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Notes tab. This panel is a simple plain-text editor to hold notes on the book in progress. Whatever contents you type here are saved
in the metadata file and reloaded with the file.</p>
<p>When the focus is in the Notes panel, the alt-ctl-L key causes the
current line number of the Edit panel cursor position to be entered, in curly braces: <tt>{1475}</tt>. The alt-ctl-P key causes the current book page
number to be entered in square brackets: <tt>[214]</tt>. Use these keys
to relate your notes to locations in the book, for example <tt>oe lig near {1475}; big table on [214]</tt>.
</p><p>
Place the cursor in or to the right of a {nnn} line number in the notes and key ctl-L. The Edit panel cursor jumps to that line. Place the cursor in or to the right of a [ppp] page number and key ctl-p. The Edit panel cursor jumps to the top of that page's text.</p>
<p>Key ctl-f for a simple Find dialog for searching in the notes.
If text is selected, it is pre-loaded in the find-text field. The search
starts at the cursor and wraps around at the end of the notes.</p>
<h2>Find Panel</h2>
<p>The Find panel has controls for search and replace, including saved searches.</p>
<h3>Find Controls</h3>
<p>The top row of five checkboxes affect the search.</p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><td style='width:6em;'>Respect Case</td><td>When checked, search is case-sensitive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whole Word</td><td>When checked, normal searches only match whole words.
Does not apply to regex (use <tt>\\b</tt> in the expression)</td></tr>
<tr><td>In Sel'n</td><td>When checked, search and replace occur only in bounds
of the selection that exists when you next click the First or Last button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Regex</td><td>When checked, the Find string is treated as a regular expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Greedy</td><td>When checked, a regular expression matches all it can;
otherwise as little as it can.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The Find text field is below the checkboxes. Here enter the text pattern
to look for. At the left is a popup menu
containing the last 10 find values you explicitly typed in the field.
(These are remembered from session to session.)
The Find text field turns pink when Regex is checked and the syntax is not valid.</p>
<p>Below the text field are four buttons that perform searches:</p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><td style='width:4em;'>Next</td><td>Search for the Find text beginning at the edit cursor and going toward the end of the document or prior selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prior</td><td>Search for the Find text beginning at the edit cursor and going back toward the top of the document or the prior selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>First</td><td>If In Sel'n is checked, set current selection as search boundary. Search for the Find text beginning at the top of the document or the
top of the selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Last</td><td>If In Sel'n is checked, set current selection as search boundary. Search for the Find text beginning at the end of the document or bottom of the selection and going backward.</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Replace Controls</h3>
<p>There are three Replace fields. They are identical in use. Each is a text
field to enter the replacement text. On the left is a popup menu with the
last 10 replacement values you typed in that field.
(These are remembered from session to session.)
On the right is a Repl button that causes the current edit selection to be
replaced with the field contents.</p>
<p>Further right are three checkboxes. 
When &amp;Next is checked, use of any Repl button is followed by
the effect of the Next button. When &amp;Prior is checked, use
of any Repl button is followed by the effect of the Prior button.</p>
<p>When the focus is in the Edit panel, ctl-= has the effect of clicking
Repl on the first replace field; ctl-t is like clicking Repl and then Next; 
and shift-ctl-t is like clicking Repl and then Prior.</p>
<p>When ALL! is checked, clicking any Repl button
causes all instances of the Find text (in the document, or in the 
current boundaries set by In Sel'n) to be looked up and replaced.
Before the replacement is done, a message is shown: "Replace <i>nn</i>
occurrences of <i>find-text</i> with <i>repl-text</i>?" and you
have the option of cancelling the operation. The replace-all 
operation is a single undo/redo step.</p>
<h3>User-defined Buttons</h3>
<p>Below the Replace controls is an array of 24 pushbuttons. 
Use these to store find/replace operations for re-use.
To store an operation, right-click (Mac users: <b>control</b>-click)
a button. A message pops up asking you to give a short label for the button.
When you do so and click OK, that label is assigned to the button,
and the state of all the find/replace controls&mdash;all checkboxes
and entry fields&mdash;is stored in that button. Whenever you want to
repeat that search, click the button to set all the find/replace
controls to the stored settings. The current button settings are remembered from session to session.</p>
<p>To save the button settings to a file select File>Save Find Buttons. Provide the name and location for the saved file, which will be saved with UTF-8 encoding (a suffix of .utf is recommended). In the saved file each non-empty button is represented on a single line.</p>
<p>To load button settings from a file, select File>Load Find Buttons.
Any button definitions in the file are assigned to the buttons.
The intent of saving and loading buttons is to be able to save
and re-use complex search operations, and exchange them with other
users. The file syntax is documented elsewhere.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Regex Syntax</h3>
<p>The Qt regex support is similar to but has fewer features than the Perl regexes used in guiguts. The following forms are used to match text.</p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><td style='width:3em;'>non-special characters</td><td>match themselves</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\</b><i>x</i></td><td>Escape for special characters: except as below, matches <i>x</i>. Use <b>\\\\</b> to match a slash.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\n</b> </td><td>Matches between lines,<tt>\\n\\n</tt> is an empty line</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\x</b><i>xxxx</i></td><td>matches Unicode character valued <i>xxxx</i>       </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>.</b> (dot)</td><td>Matches any one character <i>including newline</i>  </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\d</b> </td><td>  matches a decimal digit</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\D</b> </td><td> matches a non-digit  </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\s</b></td><td> matches a whitespace character <i>including newline</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\S</b></td><td> matches a non-whitespace character </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\w</b></td><td> matches a word character (any Unicode letter, number, or Mark) </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\W</b></td><td>matches a non-word character</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\</b><i>n</i> </td><td> matches the <i>n</i>-th captured text (same as perl/guiguts <b>$</b><i>n</i>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>[</b><i>chars</i><b>]</b></td><td> matches any one of the <i>chars</i>; may use ranges e.g. <tt>[A-Z1-9]</tt>    </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>[^</b><i>chars</i><b>]</td><td>  matches any character except <i>chars</i></td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>\\b</b></td><td>matches the zero-width boundary between a
word and non-word character. <tt>\\bon\\b</tt> matches only the word "on".</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\\B</b></td><td> matches what <b>\\b</b> doesn't. <tt>\\Bon\\B<\tt> will not match the word "on" but will match inside "tone". </td></tr>
</table><p>Any of the above expressions
can be or'd with stiles: <tt>alpha|beta</tt> means alpha or beta.
Any of those expressions may be put in parentheses to capture
the matching text for use in replacements. Any expression <i>E</i> can be quantified with these suffixes:</p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><td style='width:5em;'>  <i>E</i><b>?</b></td><td>  zero or one of <i>E</i> </td></tr>
<tr><td><i>E</i><b>+</b></td><td> one or more of <i>E</i>  </td></tr>
<tr><td> <i>E</i><b>*</b>   </td><td> zero or more of <i>E</i> </td></tr>
<tr><td> <i>E</i><b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,</b><i>m</i><b>}</b>  </td><td>from <i>n</i> to <i>m</i> of <i>E</i>, and <i>n</i> or <i>m</i> can be omitted:
<i>E</i><b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,}</b> at least <i>n</i> of <i>E</i>; <i>E</i><b>{,</b><i>m</i><b>}</b> at most <i>m</i> of <i>E</i></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Non-capturing parentheses force a match but do not capture the matching
text: <tt>(?:The color is)\s(red|green|blue)</tt> can only match a string
that begins "The color is" but the first capture, <b>\\1</b>, is what 
matched <tt>(red|green|blue)</tt>. Also supported: lookahead tests
with <b>(?=</b><i>E</i><b>)</b> and <b>(?!</b><i>E</i><b>)</b>.</p>
<p>Note: owing to some tricks PPQT plays with the Qt regex support, 
the caret and dollar codes, which usually match at beginning and end
of a line, only match at beginning and end of the document or
selection boundary. Use \\n to match at beginning and end of line.</p>
<p>Replacement text for a regex match may contain <b>\\</b><i>n</i> to refer
to the <i>n</i>th captured (parenthesized) text. None of the special
replacements supported by guiguts (such as <tt>\\U...\\E</tt> to uppercase
the text) are available.</p>
<p>The Greedy checkbox is used to set on or off the Qt "minimal" option for
regex matching but frankly, the difference between non-Greedy and
Greedy matches is hard to detect. If a regex doesn't behave as you
expect, change the state of the Greedy switch and try again.</p>
<h2>The Characters Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Char tab to show the Characters panel.
This panel displays a table of all characters seen in the document,
in four columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Glyph: the character symbol</li>
<li>Value: the hex value of the unicode character</li>
<li>Count: the number of times the character appears</li>
<li>Unicode category</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on the heading of any column to sort on that column.
After you have edited the document, the table is out of date.
Click the Refresh button
to rebuild all metadata and make the counts accurate.</p>
<p>In the upper right is a popup menu with three choices:<p>
<ul>
<li>All: show all characters</li>
<li> &#172; 7-bit: show only characters not in 7-bit ASCII</li>
<li> &#172; Latin-1: show only characters not in the Latin-1 set</li>
</ul>
<p>Doubleclick a row to copy that character into the Find text and
display the Find panel.</p>
<h2>The Words Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Word tab to see the Words panel.
This is a table of all words in the document, in three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Word: text of the word</li>
<li>Count: the number of times the word appears</li>
<li>Features: a string of letters showing information about the word,
for example <tt>Aa---X</tt>, meaning from left to right:
<ul>
<li>A if the word contains an uppercase letter, else hyphen</li>
<li>a if the word contains a lowercase letter, else hyphen</li>
<li>9 if the word contains a digit, else hyphen</li>
<li>h if the word contains a hyphen, else hyphen</li>
<li>p if the word contains an apostrophe, else hyphen</li>
<li>X if the word is in bad_words or rejected by Aspell, else hyphen</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Click on any column to sort on that column. Set the Respect Case
checkbox to decide if the Word column sort is case-sensitive.
After editing, the table is out of date. Click Refresh to rebuild all metadata
and make the table current. Use the popup menu in the upper right
to filter the table to these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>ALL: show all words</li>
<li>UPPERCASE: show only all-cap words</li>
<li>lowercase: show only lowercase words</li>
<li>mIxEdcase: show words having both upper and lowercase letters</li>
<li>Numbers: show only all-numeric words</li>
<li>Alnumeric: show words having both letters and digits</li>
<li>Hyphenated: show words containing a hyphen</li>
<li>Apostrophes: show words containing an apostrophe</li>
<li>Misspelt: show words that fail spellcheck</li>
</ul>
<p>Doubleclick a word to load that word in the Find text and display
the Find panel.</p>
<p>Right-click (Mac users: <b>control</b>-click) on a word in the first
column to open a context menu with these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add to goodwords: Add the current word to the good-words list, where
it will be saved with the metadata and never be shown as misspelt again.</li>
<li>Similar words: Filter the word list to show only words that match the
current word when letter case, hyphens, and apostrophes are ignored.</li>
<li>First harmonic: Filter the word list to show only words that are
within one edit of difference from the current word.</li>
<li>Second harmonic: Show only words that are within one or two edits
of the current word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use Similar words to find inconsistent use of hyphens. Use
First and Second Harmonic to find likely misspellings of a word.
After viewing Similar or First or Second Harmonic, select
All from the popup menu above the table to see all words again.</p>
<h2>The Pages Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Page tab to display the Pages panel. 
This is a table showing the page separator information from the original
file. This information is retained in the metadata even after the
page separator lines are deleted.</p>
<p>The main use of this table is to set the correct folio values.
Folios are the visible page numbers that are displayed by
the HTML etext. The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan#: the number of the scanned image, usually three digits; this
is the name of the .png file in the pngs folder.</li>
<li>Format: the display format for a visible folio in the HTML version</li>
<li>Action: how to compute and display the folio for this page</li>
<li>Folio: the folio (book page number) for this scanned page</li>
<li>Proofers: the userids who proofed this page at its various stages</li>
</ul>
<p>This table cannot be sorted. Doubleclick a cell in the Scan#
column to make the
editor jump to the top of that page's text.</p>
<p>Doubleclick a cell in the Action column to set the folio action
to one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add 1: this page's folio is +1 over the preceding page's</li>
<li>Set @: set this page's folio to the number in column 4</li>
<li>Skip folio: no visible page number for this image</li>
</ul>
<p>Doubleclick a number in the folio column to set a specific
numeric value to go with the Set @ action.</p>
<p>Doubleclick a cell in the Format column to set the format to
one of Arabic, roman (lowercase) or ROMAN (uppercase).</p>
<p>After making one or more of these changes, click the Update
button to update the table to reflect the changes. Using these
controls you can get the folios of the file to exactly match
the folios in the original book.</p>
<p>TBS: some way to open a proofer's profile page at pgdp.net 
by clicking in the proofer column.</p>
<h2>The Reflow Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Flow tab to display the Reflow panel.
This panel has controls related to reflowing paragraphs (TBS: and
formatting tables) in the ASCII etext (not HTML). Normal paragraphs
are flowed in a 75-character line. Other types of markup are supported
similar to guiguts:</p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Markup</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>/#..#/</b></td><td>Block Quote: paragraphs are reflowed
within left and right indents as set in the top row of controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/P..P/</b></td><td>Poetry:single lines are indented as given
in the second row of controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/*..*/</b></td><td>No-flow: the entire section may be indented
by an amount specified in the third control, otherwise no change.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/C..C/</b></td><td>Centering: single lines are indented so
as to center on the 75-char line, with at least a 2-space indent.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/L..L/<br />/$..$/<br />/X..X/</b></td><td>These sections are
skipped entirely.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Set the switches on the left center to skip over special sections.</p>
<p>The top row of controls set the default indents for block quotes.
The <i>First</i> indent applies to the first line of a paragraph;
<i>Left</i> to the other lines.
The second row of controls set the indents for poetry, in which the <i>First</i>
indent applies to every line; the <i>Left</i> indent is used only if a line
is too long to fit in 75 chars and is "folded."</p>
<p>As in guiguts, you can set the indents for a particular section by
putting one to three numbers in brackets on the top markup.
The syntax is <b>[</b><i>left</i><b>.</b><i>first</i><b>,</b><i>right</i><b>]</b> with the
<i>first</i> and <i>right</i> optional.
For example <b>/#[6]</b> starts a blockquote with a <i>Left</i> indent of 6;
<b>/#[6.12]</b> specifies <i>Left</i> of 6 but <i>First</i> of 12; 
<b>/#[8,8]</b> has <i>Left</i> and <i>Right</i> both 8; and
<b>/#[8.4,0]</b> has  <i>Left</i> 8,  <i>First</i> 4 (exdented), and
 <i>Right</i> 0. When omitted in the markup, <i>First</i> and <i>Right</i> 
 come from the panel controls. PPQT also supports this on <b>/P</b> poetry markup.</p>
<p>For Centered text, setting the "longest line+2" button adjusts
the section as far to the left as possible leaving a 2-space indent.</p>
<p>Normally you reflow after removing &lt;i>, &lt;b>, and &lt;sc> markup.
However you can preview reflow while these are still in place by setting
the controls on the right center. For example if &lt;sc> markup will
be converted to uppercase, set the control to treat this markup as 0 length.</p>
<p>TBS: controls for removing line separators interactively.</p>
<h2>The Footnote Panel</h2>
<p>TBS Mucho! Controls for validating and formatting footnotes.</p>
<h2>The HTML Panel</h2>
<p>Mondo TBS. Controls for converting to HTML</p>
<h2>The Preview Panel</h2>
<p>Small TBS: use a QWebView widget to preview the html text in the Edit panel.
Query: could this be used to open a proofer profile???
