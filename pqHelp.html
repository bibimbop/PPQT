<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>PPQT is a unified tool for use by the volunteers who post-process books for Distributed Proofreaders. It provides a text editor that integrates a number of features useful during post-processing, including display of the book's scanned pages, regular expression find/replace, spellcheck, pagination, footnoting, and html preview. This Help is its main documentation. Some additional info can
be found in the <a href='#Extras'>Extras</a> folder in the PPQT folder.</p>
<p>You can read this help text in the Help panel of the program or simply find the file <tt>pqHelp.html</tt> in the PPQT folder and open it in any browser.</p>
<p>While reading this text in the Help panel, if you click on a link, you can get back to the text by keying ctl-[ or ctl-b (mac users see next paragraph).</p>
<h2>Mac Users Note</h2>
<p> Throughout this Help, when you read <b>ctl-</b>
you think <b>cmd-</b>. And when you read <b>alt-</b>, you think <b>opt-</b>.
Qt is quite consistent in these mappings. However, when you see <b>control-</b>
(not <b>ctl-</b>), that really means, the Control key on every platform.</p>
<p>For example, in this Help panel the "back" function is ctl-b or ctl-[. For a mac, that means cmd-[ or cmd-b. Similarly, it says below that to set bookmark 1, you key ctl-alt-1. As a Mac user you will  know to substitute cmd- for ctl- and opt- for alt-, and set bookmark 1 using cmd-opt-1.</p>

<h2 id='New'>What's New in This Version</h2>
<p>(See also <a href='#OldNew'>What Was New</a> for previous changes.)</p>
<h3>What's New as of 22 December 2012</h3>
<ul>
<li>The status bar of the main window now has both a line number and
a column number display. The column number reflects the nominal position
of the edit cursor. When there is a selection, the nominal position may be the
left or the right end of the selected text, depending on how the selection was made.</li>
<li>After any successful
search the found text is centered in the text window. If the found selection is
large, the top of the selection is always visible although the end of the selection might be out of sight.</li>
<li>The Preview panel has a new button, "Refresh + Clear," which clears
the browser cache so that images are reloaded from disk.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor bug with the display of text after performing a replace
of text at the end of a line with a newline.</li>
<li>The file-open dialog for Load Find Buttons and Save Find Buttons is
initialized to the PPQT "extras" folder, or to the last-used folder for loading
or saving find buttons.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='Files'>Files and Folders</h2>
<p>PPQT edits one book text at a time, for example <tt>afinebook.txt</tt>. 
If you need to open a second document (for example, a commented copy from Smooth Reading), just start a second copy of PPQT.</p>
<h3 id='Encodings'>File Encodings and Suffixes</h3>
<p>PPQT holds the document in memory in Unicode, which supports virtually any alphabet or special characters. This is subject to two limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>PPQT can only display characters that are defined in the font you select
(see <a href='#Edit'>Edit Panel</a> below). DPCustomMono2, for example,
lacks Greek and Cyrillic. Courier New, however, has a wide repertoire including
Hebrew and Arabic.</li>
<li>Although it can display alphabets such as Arabic, PPQT does not understand right to left editing. The edit cursor only moves left to right during text entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The characters in documents on disk are encoded in some way. The important encodings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>UTF-8, which can represent any Unicode character.</li>
<li>ISO-8859-1, aka Latin-1, a set of 191 characters.</li>
<li>Windows CP1252 contains the same 191 characters as Latin-1 but adds 27 more
that are not in Latin-1. CP1252 is not supported by PG, but Windows utilities such as Wordpad may save files in that encoding.</li>
<li>Mac Roman defines many, but not all, of the characters in CP1252 (but with different numeric values), and also some special characters not in either CP1252 or Latin-1. Mac Roman is not supported by PG, but Mac utilities such as Textedit may save files in that encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other encodings but PPQT only supports the above four for input, and only UTF-8 and Latin-1 for output.</p>
<p>In order to load a document with its special characters intact and un-garbled, PPQT needs to know which encoding the file uses. It has several ways of finding this out.</p>
<ol>
<li>When saving a file, PPQT writes the encoding into the metadata file (next topic). Thus once you have saved a book it always reopens with the same encoding.</li>
<li>Project Gutenberg (PG) requires all etext files to have the suffix <tt>.txt</tt> regardless of their encoding (crazy, but true). However it is conventional to indicate UTF-8 by ending the filename with <tt>-u</tt>, <tt>-utf</tt>, or <tt>-utf8</tt>, for example, <tt>afinebook-utf.txt</tt>. PPQT recognizes this and opens such a file as UTF-8.</li>
<li>You can also end a filename with <tt>-l</tt>, <tt>-ltn</tt> or <tt>-ltn1</tt> to signal that it is encoded Latin-1, for example <tt>myfinebook-ltn.txt</tt>.</li>
<li>Per the standard, HTML files should either be UTF-8 or else they should have a <tt>charset=</tt><i>encoding</i> parameter in the first 1024 characters of the file. When loading or saving a file of type <tt>.htm</tt> or <tt>.html</tt>, PPQT looks for this parameter and uses the encoding specified. If there is no parameter, it uses UTF-8.</li>
<li>Although PG does not permit using file suffixes other than <tt>.txt</tt> for an etext, other suffixes are still useful for non-book files such as a good_words or "scannos" word list. Hence PPQT looks for these file suffixes:
<ul>
<li><tt>.utf</tt> or <tt>.utx</tt> to signal UTF-8</li>
<li><tt>.ltn</tt> to signal Latin-1</li>
<li><tt>.win</tt> to signal Windows CP1252</li>
<li><tt>.mac</tt> to signal Mac Roman</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When none of methods 1-5 reveal the encoding, PPQT feeds the first 4096 bytes of the file to a package that attempts to infer the encoding from the byte values used. If the package reports an encoding at a high confidence level PPQT uses that encoding. Otherwise it displays an error message.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can bypass this complexity by using the File menu command Open With Encoding, and selecting one encoding from the sub-menu. The file you select is opened with that encoding.</p>
<p>When saving a file, PPQT will only use UTF-8 or Latin-1. It applies rules 2-5 above to discover which you want to use. To force one or the other, save the file with an indicator in the filename or file suffix, e.g. to force saving as Latin-1, save to <i>bookname</i><tt>-ltn.txt</tt>.</p>
<h3>Metadata</h3>
When opening  <tt>afinebook.txt</tt>, PPQT looks for a file named  <tt>afinebook.txt.meta</tt> in the same location (i.e. the full book name
plus <tt>.meta</tt>). If the meta file
is not found, PPQT assumes this is the first time it has opened this book.
It scans the text gathering information including the location of page separator lines, and counting words and characters. These items and other useful things (defined bookmarks, your notes, the file encoding, etc.) are saved in the <tt>.meta</tt> file when the file is saved. When the <tt>.meta</tt> file does
exist, PPQT loads the metadata items from it.</p>
<p>Feel free to examine or edit the metadata file, but be aware that it is encoded UTF-8. If strange characters appear, your editor app did not use the utf-encoding to load it. Do not save the metadata file unless you are sure you are loading and saving it in UTF-8 format.</p>
<h3>Page Images</h3>
<p>PPQT expects to find a folder named <tt>pngs</tt> in the same location as
the text file, containing the scan images for the book. These are displayed in 
the Pngs panel.</p>
<h2 id='Main'>The Main Window</h2>
<p>When launched, PPQT displays a single window divided in two by a vertical bar. The left side is the Edit Panel where you edit the document. The right side
is a tabbed set of panels for different functions. All these panels are described below.</p>
<p>You can adjust the size of the main window and its location on the screen. You can drag the vertical "splitter" left and right to give more or less space to each half. These geometry changes are remembered from session to session.</p>
<h2 id='Edit'>The Edit Panel</h2>
<p>The left-side panel is a typical modern plain text line-editor.
It uses a monospaced font, defaulting to Deja Vu Mono when available
or to Courier New.
Use the View&nbsp;>&nbsp;Font... command to select a font from your system, which will be remembered from session to session. It would be a very bad idea to use anything but a monospaced font.</p>
<p>Below the edit panel is a status area where activity messages appear
from time to time. Bottom center is a line-number field displaying the
line number of the edit cursor. Type a new number in
that field and press Return to jump to a different line.</p>
<p>Next to the line number field is a field showing the cursor column
position. When no text is selected, this is the column number of the character to the right of the insertion point. When there is a selection, the position number is either the left or the right end of the selected text, depending on how the selection was made (e.g. by dragging left to right, or right to left).</p>
<p>Further to the
right is a progress bar that shows the status of some long-running operations.</p>
<h3>Selecting Text</h3>
<p>Select text as usual by dragging,
or by click then shift-click,
or by doubleclick (word) or  tripleclick (line).
Extend a selection by holding the shift key when using a cursor movement key
or selecting a bookmark (see below).
PPQT does not support rectangular selections or discontinuous selections.</p>
<p>You can move text by dragging the selection, and
you can copy text by alt-dragging,
in addition to the usual copy and paste keystrokes and Edit menu commands.</p>
<h3>Edit Keys</h3>
<p>The Edit panel supports the following special keystrokes.</p>
<h4>Cursor Movement Keys</h4>
The arrow keys, Home, End, PageUp and PageDown keys work together
with the control key to move the edit cursor
following the usual conventions for your operating system.
Add the shift key to any cursor move to extend the selection by that amount.
For example, ctl-right arrow goes to the end of the line, but shift-ctl-right arrow selects text to the end of the line.</p>
<h4>Editing Keys</h4>
<ul>
<li>ctl-c/ctl-x/ctl-v: copy/cut/paste</li>
<li>ctl-z: undo</li>
<li>ctl-y, also shift-ctl-z: redo</li>
<li>ctl-u, ctl-l, ctl-i: change selection to uppercase, lowercase, titlecase (Unicode-aware)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Find/Replace Keys</h4>
<p>The following keys work in conjunction with the <a href="#Find">Find panel</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>ctl-f: display the Find panel and put the focus there</li>
<li>shift-ctl-f: copy selection to Find panel and put focus there ("find this")</li>
<li>ctl-g: repeat the last search forward (same as Find Next)</li>
<li>shift-ctl-g: repeat last search backward (same as Find Prior)</li>
<li>ctl-=: replace selection (same as Find panel replace #1)</li>
<li>ctl-t: replace selection and repeat find forward</li>
<li>shift-ctl-t: replace selection and repeat find backward</li>
</ul>
<h4>Miscellaneous Keys</h4>
<ul>
<li>ctl-hyphen: display text 1pt smaller</li>
<li>ctl-+: display text 1pt larger</li>
<li>ctl-alt-1 through ctl-alt-9: set bookmark 1-9 to cursor (bookmarks
are saved in the metadata file)</li>
<li>ctl-1 through ctl-9: jump to bookmark 1-9</li>
<li>ctl-shift-1 through ctl-shift-9: extend selection to bookmark 1-9.
(Note to Mac users: cmd-shift-3 is "capture screen" and cmd-shift-4 is "capture selection". If you want to use these as bookmark 3 or 4 with selection, go to System Preferences, Keyboard, Keyboard shortcuts, click on Screen Shots,
and disable these two keys.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id='ContextMenu'>Context Menu</h4>
<p>Right-click (Mac: <b>control</b>-click) anywhere in the Edit pane to 
bring up a context menu with some edit commands. If the current
selection is a single word, this context menu has an item that will
enter that word in the good-words list; see <a href='#Spellcheck'>Spellcheck</a>. This cannot be undone (except by editing the meta file).
<h2 id='Scannos'>Scanno Highlighting</h2>
<p>Use the File > Scannos menu command to load a file of scannos: a text file with one word per line (e.g. <tt>extras/en-common</tt>). (You can use any
of the filename or suffix rules listed <a href='#Encodings'>above</a> to indicate the encoding of the scannos file.)</p>
<p>The path to the scannos file is remembered from session to session and it is re-loaded each time PPQT is restarted, if it can be found.</p>
<p>Use the View > Scannos menu command to turn on scanno highlighting. This puts a lilac background on any word that appears in the scannos file. Be patient when initiating scanno highlighting, it may tie up PPQT for several seconds in a large book.</p>
<h2 id='Spellcheck'>Spellcheck</h2>
<p>When PPQT opens a book for the first time (no <tt>.meta</tt> file exists), it looks in the same folder for a file whose name begins with <tt>good_words</tt>
and loads its contents. It looks for a file whose name begins with <tt>bad_words</tt> also. You can use any
of the filename or suffix rules listed <a href='#Encodings'>above</a> to indicate the encoding of these files.</p>
<p>These lists of "good" and "bad" words are saved in the metadata file thereafter. More "good" words can be added from the <a href='#Words'>Words panel</a> or with the <a href='#ContextMenu'>context menu</a>.</p>
<p>Use View&nbsp;>&nbsp;Dictionary to select a dictionary for the main language of the book. This choice of main dictionary is remembered from session to session. Dictionaries for several languages are included; more can be added by a procedure documented elsewhere. After changing the main dictionary, click Refresh in the <a href='#Words'>Words panel</a> to re-check all spelling.</p>
<p>When building or refreshing its metadata, PPQT checks all words for spelling. A "bad" word is assumed to be misspelt. A "good" word is assumed to be correct. Any word that is not in those lists is presented to the spell-checker for testing against the current dictionary.</p>
<p>Use the View&nbsp;>&nbsp;Spelling command to turn on red-underlining of misspelt words. Be patient, this may lock up PPQT for several seconds in a large book.</p>
<p>You can mark any word, phrase or section to be checked against an alternate dictionary with the nonstandard tag <b><tt>&lt;sd</tt></b>&nbsp;<i>dictag</i><b>&gt;</b>...<b><tt>&lt;/sd></tt></b>, for example<blockquote><tt>He whispered &lt;sd fr_FR>&lt;i>Je t'aime&lt;/i>&lt;/sd></tt></blockquote>Obviously these nonstandard tags must be removed before the book is finalized. The use of a single alternate dictionary does not slow spellcheck much. However, the use of two or more alternate languages may slow spellcheck a lot.
<h2 id='Pngs'>The Pngs Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Pngs tab to display the Pngs panel, which displays scan images loaded from the <tt>pngs</tt> folder. It normally displays the image that corresponds to the present edit cursor position.</p>
<p>When the focus is in the Pngs panel (click in it), ctl-hyphen zooms out and ctl-plus zooms in. The current zoom setting is remembered from session to session. If the image is larger than the panel, scroll bars appear. Use them to center the text. The scroll position is kept as pages change.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the panel is a slider with which you can adjust the zoom from 15% to 250%. Beside it, the button "To Width" causes the display to zoom to fill the width of the panel with the text. "To Height" zooms it to fill the height of the panel with the text. Both of these buttons work by scanning the image pixel by pixel to find the outermost dark spots. Many scan images have random blots and dots in the margins that make PPQT think the text is wider or taller than it looks to your eye.</p>
<p>You can use the PgUp and PgDn keys in the Pngs panel to flip backward and forward through the scan images. However, as soon as you move the text edit cursor, the Pngs panel snaps back to the image corresponding to the cursor.</p>
<h2 id='Notes'>The Notes Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Notes tab. This panel is a simple plain-text editor to hold notes on the book in progress. Whatever contents you type here are saved
in the <tt>.meta</tt> file and reloaded with the book.</p>
<p>When the focus is in the Notes panel, the alt-ctl-L key causes the
current line number of the Edit panel cursor position to be entered, in curly braces: <tt>{1475}</tt>. (Note: under Ubuntu, alt-ctl-L may be the keyboard shortcut for Lock Screen. Use Ubuntu's Preferences &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts to change this to, e.g., shift-alt-ctl-L.)</p><p>The alt-ctl-P key causes the current scan image number to be entered in square brackets: <tt>[214]</tt>. Use these keys to relate your notes to locations in the book, for example <blockquote>
<tt>oe lig near {1475} <br />
big table on [214]</tt>.</blockquote>
</p><p>
Place the cursor in or to the right of a {nnn} line number in the notes and key ctl-L. The Edit panel cursor jumps to that line. Place the cursor in or to the right of a [ppp] page number and key ctl-p. The Edit panel cursor jumps to the top of that page's text.</p>
<p>Key ctl-f for a simple Find dialog for searching in the notes.
If text is selected, it is pre-loaded in the find-text field. The search
starts at the cursor and wraps around at the end of the notes.</p>
<h2 id='Find'>The Find Panel</h2>
<p>The Find panel has controls for search and replace, including saved searches.</p>
<p>Searching and Replacing are done within top and bottom boundaries which are initially the beginning and end of the document.</p>
<p>Upon doing any search, keyboard focus returns to the Edit panel.</p>
<h3>Find Controls</h3>
<p>The top row of five checkboxes affect the search.</p>
<table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;'>
<tr><td style='width:6em;'>Respect Case</td><td>When checked, search is case-sensitive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whole Word</td><td>When checked, normal searches only match whole words.
Does not apply to regex searches (use <tt>\b</tt> in the expression)</td></tr>
<tr><td>In Sel'n</td><td>When checked, search and replace occur within the span of text that is selected when you click the First or Last button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Regex</td><td>When checked, the Find string is treated as a regular expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Greedy</td><td>When checked, a regular expression matches all it can;
otherwise as little as it can.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The Find text field is below the checkboxes. Here enter the text pattern
to look for. At the left is a popup menu
containing the last 10 find values you explicitly typed in the field.
(These are remembered from session to session.)
The Find text field turns pink when Regex is checked and the syntax is not valid.</p>
<p>Below the text field are four buttons that perform searches:</p>
<table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;'>
<tr><td style='width:4em;'>Next</td><td>Search for the Find text beginning at the edit cursor and going toward the bottom boundary. Pressing Return in the Find text field is the same as clicking Next.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prior</td><td>Search for the Find text beginning at the edit cursor and going back toward the top boundary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>First</td><td>If In Sel'n is checked, set the top and bottom of the
current selection as the search boundaries; otherwise set to the whole document.
Search for the Find text beginning at the top boundary and going forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Last</td><td>If In Sel'n is checked, set the top and bottom of the
current selection as the search boundaries; otherwise set to the whole document.
Search for the Find text beginning at the bottom boundary and going backward.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>To simply search forward from the cursor position, press Return while in the Find text field, or click Next. To search backward, click Prior. To search from the top, use First. To search backward from the bottom, use Last.  Search does not "wrap around" at the end of the document. When any search succeeds, the focus moves to the Edit panel.</p>
<p>When the focus is in the Edit panel, keying ctl-F makes the Find panel visible and puts the focus in it. Keying shift-ctl-F does the same but also copies the current text selection into the Find text field.</p>
<p>When the focus is in the Edit panel, keying ctl-G is the same as Next and shift-ctl-G is the same as Prior.</p>
<h3>Replace Controls</h3>
<p>There are three Replace fields. They are identical in use. Each is a text field to enter the replacement text. On the left of each field is a popup menu with the last 10 replacement strings you used out of that field.
(These are remembered from session to session.)
On the right of each field is a Repl button that causes the current edit selection to be replaced with the field contents.</p>
<p>Further right are three checkboxes. When &amp;Next is checked, use of any Repl button is followed by the effect of the Next button. When &amp;Prior is checked, use of any Repl button is followed by the effect of the Prior button.</p>
<p>When the focus is in the Edit panel, ctl-= has the effect of clicking Repl on the first replace field; ctl-t is like clicking Repl and then Next;  and shift-ctl-t is like clicking Repl and then Prior.</p>
<p>When ALL! is checked, clicking any Repl button causes all instances of the Find text within the search boundaries to be looked up and replaced. The replace-all  operation is a single undo/redo step. Before the replacement is done, a message is shown: "Replace <i>nn</i> occurrences of <i>find-text</i> with <i>repl-text</i>?" and you have the option of cancelling the operation.</p>
<p>To replace every occurrence of a string, but only within a portion of the document:</p>
<ul><li>Put the text to find in the Find text field.</li>
<li>Put the replace text in a Replace field.</li>
<li>In the Edit panel, select the span of text where replacements are to happen (for example, drag to select the Table of Contents).</li>
<li>Set the In Sel'n switch on.</li>
<li>Click First (or Last) to establish the boundaries. Also jumps to and selects the first (or last) occurrence of the string.</li>
<li>Optionally, keep clicking Next (or Prior) to step through the span of text and verify all the locations to be changed.</li>
<li>Set the ALL! checkbox on.</li>
<li>Click Repl on the appropriate Replace field.</li>
<li>Note the count of replacements in the dialog and if they look right, click OK.</li>
<li>Inspect the result and if wrong, key ctl-Z (or Edit&nbsp;>&nbsp;Undo).</li>
</ul>
<h3>User-defined Buttons</h3>
<p>Below the Replace controls is an array of 24 pushbuttons. 
Here you can store find/replace operations to be used again later.
To store an operation, right-click (Mac users: <b>control</b>-click)
a button. A message pops up asking you to give a short label for the button.
When you do so and click OK, that label is assigned to the button,
and the state of all the find/replace controls&mdash;all checkboxes
and entry fields&mdash;is stored in that button. Whenever you want to
repeat that operation, click the button. All the find/replace
controls are returned to the stored settings.
The button contents are remembered from session to session.</p>
<p>To clear the contents of a button, right-click it, clear the label field to empty, and click OK.</p>
<p>To save the button settings to a file, select File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Save Find Buttons. Provide the name and location for the saved file. PPQT uses its <a href='#Encodings'>encoding rules 2-5</a> to select between UTF-8 and Latin-1 for this file. A suffix of <tt>.utf</tt> is the simplest way to make sure all special characters are preserved. In the saved file each non-empty button is represented in text form. (Feel free to edit it.)</p>
<p>To load button settings from a file, select File&nbsp;>&nbsp;Load Find Buttons and choose a file of saved buttons. The file's encoding can be indicated by the name or suffix, or will be assumed to be UTF-8. Any valid button definitions in the file are assigned to the buttons. Rather strict controls are applied, but no diagnostics are issued. An invalid button definition is just silently ignored.</p>
<p>
The intent of saving and loading buttons is to be able to save
and re-use complex search operations, and to exchange them with other
users. See the <a href='#Extras'>Extras</a> folder in the PPQT folder for some saved button definitions and a note on the format of a file of saved buttons.</p>
<h3>Regex Syntax</h3>
<p>The Regular Expression (regex) support provided by Qt4 is similar to, but has fewer features than, the Perl regexes used in guiguts. (Qt version 5, planned for 2013, has better support.) The following forms are used to match text.</p>
<table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;'>
<tr><td style='width:4em;'>non-special characters</td><td>match themselves</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>\</b><i>c</i></td><td>Escape for special characters: except as documented below, <b>\</b><i>c</i> matches <i>c</i>. Use <b>\\</b> to match a slash.</td></tr>

</table><p>Any of the above expressions
can be or'd with stiles: <tt>alpha|beta</tt> means alpha or beta.
Any of those expressions may be put in parentheses to capture
the matching text for use in replacements. Any expression <i>E</i> can be quantified with these suffixes:</p>
<table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;'>
<tr><td style='width:5em;'>  <i>E</i><b>?</b></td><td>  zero or one of <i>E</i> </td></tr>

</table>
<p>Non-capturing parentheses force a match but do not capture the matching
text: <tt>(?:The color is)\s(red|green|blue)</tt> can only match a string
that begins "The color is" but the first capture, <b>\1</b>, is what 
matched <tt>(red|green|blue)</tt>.</p>
<p>Lookahead tests with <b>(?=</b><i>E</i><b>)</b> and <b>(?!</b><i>E</i><b>)</b> are supported: <tt>Fred(?=\n)</tt> 
matches "Fred" only at the end of a line; <tt>Fred(?!\n)</tt> only when
not at end of line. However the lookbehind tests of Perl regexes are not supported.</p>
<p>Note: owing to some tricks PPQT plays with the Qt regex support, 
the caret and dollar codes, which usually match at beginning and end
of a line, only match at top and bottom search boundary respectively.
Use <tt>\n</tt> to match at beginning and end of line.</p>
<p>As usual, replacement text for a regex match may contain <b>\</b><i>i</i> to refer to the <i>i</i>th captured (parenthesized) text. However, none of the special replacements supported by guiguts (such as <tt>\U...\E</tt> to uppercase
the text) are available.</p>
<h2 id='Chars'>The Characters Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Char tab to show the Characters panel.
This panel displays a table of all characters seen in the document,
in five columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Glyph</b>: The character symbol.</li>
<li><b>Value</b>: The hex value of the Unicode character.</li>
<li><b>Count</b>: The number of times the character appears in the document.</li>
<li><b>Entity</b>: The  HTML/XML Entity code for this character.</li>
<li><b>Unicode category</b>: The Unicode category of the character.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on the heading of any column to sort the table on that column.
After you have edited the document, the table is out of date.
Click the Refresh button
to rebuild all metadata and make the counts accurate.</p>
<p>In the upper right is a popup menu with three choices:<p>
<ul>
<li>All: show all characters</li>
<li> &#172; 7-bit: show only characters not in 7-bit ASCII</li>
<li> &#172; Latin-1: show only characters not in the Latin-1 set</li>
</ul>
<p>Use this menu to easily find characters that are not allowed
in a 7-bit file or a Latin-1 file, or to discover if the file needs
to be saved as UTF-8.</p>
<p>If you double-click the character glyph or value, the character 
is copied into the Find text field and a First search is done so the first
use of the character is highlighted in the document. Do this to search for the character in the document.</p>
<p>If you double-click on the Entity column, the glyph is copied to
the Find text field while the Entity code is copied to the first
Replace text. This makes it easy to replace a character with its Entity code.</p>
<h2 id='Words'>The Words Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Word tab to see the Words panel.
This is a table of all words in the document, in three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Word</b>: text of the word</li>
<li><b>Count</b>: the number of times the word appears</li>
<li><b>Features</b>: a string of letters showing information about the word,
for example <tt>Aa---X</tt>. These codes contain, from left to right:
<ul>
<li>A if the word contains an uppercase letter, else hyphen</li>
<li>a if the word contains a lowercase letter, else hyphen</li>
<li>9 if the word contains a digit, else hyphen</li>
<li>h if the word contains a hyphen, else hyphen</li>
<li>p if the word contains an apostrophe, else hyphen</li>
<li>X if the word is in bad_words or fails spellcheck, else hyphen</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Click on any column to sort on that column. Set the Respect Case
checkbox to decide if the Word column sort is case-sensitive.
When the table is large you can quickly locate words beginning with
a particular letter. With the keyboard focus is in the Words panel
and the table sorted ascending on the first column, key the
initial letter you want. The table scrolls to show the first word
beginning with that letter. The jump is case-sensitive when the 
Respect Case switch is checked; that is, use shift-E to find words
beginning with uppercase E.</p>
<p>Double-click a word to copy that word into the paste buffer, load the word in the Find text, and do a First search to highlight the first use of the word in the document.</p>
<p>
After the text is edited the table is out of date.
Click Refresh to rebuild all metadata
and make the table current.</p>
<p>Use the popup menu in the upper right
to filter the table to these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>ALL: show all words</li>
<li>UPPERCASE: show only all-cap words</li>
<li>lowercase: show only lowercase words</li>
<li>mIxEdcase: show words having both upper and lowercase letters</li>
<li>Numbers: show only all-numeric words</li>
<li>Alnumeric: show words having both letters and digits</li>
<li>Hyphenated: show words containing a hyphen</li>
<li>Apostrophes: show words containing an apostrophe</li>
<li>Misspelt: show words that fail <a href='#Spellcheck'>spellcheck</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can select one or more words by clicking, dragging, shift-clicking or
ctl-clicking in the first column. When a word or words are selected, you can key
<b>shift-</b>ctl-c to copy the selected words for pasting elsewhere.</p>
<p>Right-click (Mac users: <b>control</b>-click) on a word in the first
column to open a context menu with these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add to goodwords: Add all selected words to the good-words list
and show them as correctly spelled.</li>
<li>Similar words: Filter the word list to show only words that match the
clicked word when letter case, hyphens, and apostrophes are ignored.</li>
<li>First harmonic: Filter the word list to show only words that are
within one edit of difference from the clicked word.</li>
<li>Second harmonic: Show only words that are within one or two edits
of the clicked word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use Similar words to find inconsistent use of hyphens. Use
First and Second Harmonic to find likely misspellings of a word. (For example,
use Second Harmonic on the word Footnote to find some improperly-coded
Footnote markups.)
After viewing Similar or First or Second Harmonic, select
All from the popup menu above the table to see all words again.</p>

<h2 id='Pages'>The Pages Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Page tab to display the Pages panel. 
The body of this panel is a table showing the information extracted from the page separator lines the first time the file was opened. The information is retained in the metadata even after the text of the page separator lines has been deleted. The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan#: the number of the scanned image, usually three or four digits; this
is the filename of the <tt>.png</tt> image file in the <tt>pngs</tt> folder.</li>
<li>Format: the display format for a visible folio: arabic or roman numerals.</li>
<li>Action: how to compute and display the folio for this page</li>
<li>Folio: the folio (book page number) for this scanned page</li>
<li>Proofers: the PGDP user-ids who proofed this page at its various stages</li>
</ul>
<p>The table is always in scan image order. Double-click a cell in the Scan# column to make the Edit panel jump to the top of that page's text.</p>
<p>
Double-click a cell in the Action column to set the folio action to one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add 1: this page's folio is +1 over the preceding page's</li>
<li>Set @: set this page's folio to the number in column 4</li>
<li>Skip folio: show no visible page number for this image</li>
</ul>
<p>Double-click a number in the folio column to set a specific
numeric value to go with the Set @ action.</p>
<p>Double-click a cell in the Format column to set the format to
one of Arabic, roman (lowercase) or ROMAN (uppercase).</p>
<p>After making one or more of these changes, click the Update
button to update the table to reflect the changes. Using these
controls you can get the folios of the file to exactly match
the folios in the original book.</p>
<h3>Inserting Folio Text</h3>
<p>At the top of the panel is a text-entry field and an Insert button.
Use these to insert a text pattern at the start of every page (except
pages for which the Action is Skip folio). The text pattern may contain <tt>\n</tt> to insert a line-break, and it may contain <tt>%f</tt> to insert the
folio number for that page. Insert
any unique pattern that you can extend later with regular expression
replacements, for example <tt>[=%f=]</tt>. The full pattern for
HTML folios in the side margin is:<br /><pre>
<tt>&lt;span class='pgnum'>&lt;a id='Page_%f' name='Page_%f' href='#Page_%f'>[Pg&amp;nbsp;%f]&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n</tt>
</pre></p>
<p>Inserting folio text is a single undo/redo operation.</p>
<h2 id='Flow'>The Reflow Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Flow tab to display the Reflow panel.
This panel has controls related to reflowing paragraphs and marked-up
sections in the ASCII etext, and for HTML conversion.
</p>
<h3>Markup Codes</h3>
<p>Use the following codes to mark sections for special treatment in the
reflow of ASCII etext and during HTML conversion. During reflow, normal paragraphs are flowed within a maximum width, usually 72 characters. Other markup sections are supported as follows:</p>
<table border='1' style='border-collapse:collapse;'>
<tr><th>Markup</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>/Q..Q/</b></td><td>Block Quote: paragraphs are reflowed
within left and right indents as set in the top row of controls.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/U..U/</b></td><td>Unsigned list: text is reflowed by paragraphs,
with the first line of each paragraph indented 2 and other lines indented 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/P..P/</b></td><td>Poetry:single lines are indented as given
in the second row of controls. Line numbers are pushed to the right margin.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/R..R/</b></td><td>Each line is aligned right.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/*..*/</b></td><td>No-flow: the entire section may be indented
by an amount specified in the third control, otherwise no change.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/C..C/</b></td><td>Centering: single lines are indented so
as to be centered, with at least a 2-space indent.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/T..T/</b><br /><b>/TM..T/</b></td>
<td>Table formatting, see discussion below</td>
<tr><td><b>/X..X/</b></td><td>Preformatted section, left entirely alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/F..F/</b></td><td>Footnote section, left entirely alone.</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>ASCII Reflow</h3>
<p>ASCII reflow involves arranging the text to fit in a maximum width and also 
formatting quotes, tables, and other special sections.</p>
<h4>Setting Margins and Indents</h4>
<p>The top row of controls set the default indents for block quotes.
The <i>First</i> indent applies to the first line of a paragraph;
<i>Left</i> to the other lines. The <i>Right</i> indent causes lines to
be shorter than the maximum width by this amount.</p>
<p>The second row of controls set the indents for poetry, in which the <i>First</i> indent applies to every line; the <i>Left</i> indent is used only if a line is too long to fit in the maximum width and is folded.</p>
<p>At the left of the third row is a pair of Text width controls, one for the
optimal (preferred) line length, and a second for the absolute maximum line of text. When reflowing paragraphs most lines will around the optimal length and none will exceed the maximum. Typical settings are 72 and 75. The maximum length is the default width for tables.</p>
<p>For Centered text, setting the "doc" button causes each line to be centered on the text width value. Setting the "self" button adjusts
a centered section as far to the left as possible leaving a 2-space indent.
</p>
<p>You can specify the First, Left and/or Right indent for any markup section
by writing <b>F:</b><i>nn</i> <b>L:</b><i>nn</i> <b>R:</b><i>nn</i> following
the start of the markup. For example <tt>/Q F:8 L:6</tt> starts a 
block-quote markup with those margins, overriding the <i>First</i> and <i>Left</i> margins set with the visible controls, but using the <i>Right</i> from the control.</p>
<p>You can write these explicit indent values on Quote, Poetry and List markups. You can also use <b>R:</b><i>nn</i> on Right markup to set a right margin; and <b>L:</b><i>nn</i> on no-reflow (/*) markup to set a left margin.</p>
<h4>Reflowing</h4>
<p>Select a portion of text and click Reflow Now: Selection, or use
Reflow Now: Document to reflow the whole document. Reflow is a single
undo/redo operation: perform it; inspect the result; use ctl-z to undo; adjust the markup and try again. During reflow, the markup codes are retained, and you can apply reflow multiple times without harm.</p>
<p>Before doing reflow you can
set the switches on the left center to skip over special sections. For example set the skip-Tables checkbox so that /T markup is treated the same as /X and  left alone.</p>
<p>Normally you reflow after removing &lt;i>, &lt;b>, and &lt;sc> markup.
However you can preview reflow while these are still in place by setting
the controls on the right center. For example if &lt;sc> markup will
be converted to uppercase, set the control to treat this markup as 0 length.
(This does not work for tables at this time. Set the skip button for tables
until you have removed the i/b/sc markup from the text.)</p>
<p>Paragraphs of normal text and paragraphs in block quotes and lists are reflowed within the text margin settings. First, Left and Right margin settings are deducted from both numbers, so if the text widths are set to 72 and 74 (for example), and the Left and Right margins are 4 and 4, the effective margins are optimal 64 and maximum 66.</p>
<p>Paragraph text is reflowed within the effective margins using an optimal algorithm which gives more even line-breaks than the usual "greedy" algorithm.</p>
<h4>Nesting Markups</h4>
<p>To a limited degree you can nest the markups. For example you can nest
a /P poetry section within a /Q block quote section or a /U list section.
You can nest a /R right align section in poetry or a quote to provide a signature or letterhead line. Multiple levels of nesting (/R within /P within /Q) are possible. The First, Left and Right indents for a nested section are taken relative to the indents for its containing section.</p>
<h3 id='Table'>Table Markup</h3>
PPQT treats tables as a special kind of reflow. You mark up the table text with <b>/T...T/</b> and some other parameters. During reflow the table is formatted. If the result is not perfect, undo, adjust the markup, try again.</p>
<p>A table is a series of column values arranged in rows. The column values within each row are separated in one of two ways: by strings of two or more spaces, or with stile (|) characters.</p>
<p>A single-line table has one table row per text line. It is marked up with  <b>/T..T/</b> Here is a simple table with two rows and two columns.</p>
<pre>/T
column 1    755.00
another row  2000.00
T/</pre><p>A multi-line table has one or more text lines per logical row,
and the rows are separated by blank lines. The markup starts with <b>/TM</b>.
Here is a multiline table, a typical table of contents:</p>
<pre>/TM
Introduction.--The Present Need   xiii

Chapter I. Applied Art    1

Chapter IV. The Nature and
Properties of Clay   29
T/
</pre>
<p>PPQT indents a table two spaces, an etext requirement that prevents an etext reader from reflowing formatted text. It indents more if the table is nested in another markup. By default the table is formatted to fill the maximum paragraph width set in the controls, or narrower when the table is nested in a markup with left and right indents.</p>
<p>By default column text is aligned left, and columns are given widths
roughly in proportion to their contents. However, you can specify detailed controls on the opening markup line.</p>
<p>Specify properties of the whole table with <b>T(</b><i>properties</i><b>)</b> where the <i>properties</i> can be:</p>
<ul><li><b>W:</b><i>nn</i> for the width of the table.</li>
<li><b>S:'|'</b> (a stile in single quotes) to have the right side of the finished table be a column of
stile characters.</li>
<li><b>T:'-'</b> to have the top line of the table be a row of hyphens.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example <tt>/TM T(W:50)</tt> begins a multi-line table with a width of 50. The width specified here can be wider than the text margin, and this is not checked.</p>
<p>Set the default properties for all columns with <b>C(</b><i>properties</i><b>)</b>, where
the <i>properties</i> can be:</p>
<ul><li><b>W:</b><i>nn</i> for the minimum width of every column.
(PPQT will give columns more width than this to fill the table width, or to fit the contents of the widest cell.)</li>
<li><b>A:R/L/C/D</b> to align the cell contents left, right, centered or decimal.</li>
<li><b>B:'-'</b> to have each cell have a line of hyphens under it.</li>
<li><b>S:'|'</b> to have the left side of each column be a column of stiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set the width and alignment properties of a specific column <i>n</i> by writing <i>n</i><b>(</b><i>properties</i><b>)</b>. The properties you can give for a specific column are:</p>
<ul><li><b>W:</b><i>nn</i> for the minimum width of that column.</li>
<li><b>A:R/L/C/D</b> to align the cell contents left, right, centered or decimal.</li>
<li><b>S:'&nbsp;'</b> to have the left side of this column be blank.</li>
</ul>
Here is a fully-specified table before reflow:</p>
<pre>/TM TABLE(TOP:'-' WIDTH:40 SIDE:'|') COL(B:'-' S:'|') 2(A:R W:12)
cell  cell   now is the time for all 
one   two    good parties to end     

row 2 cell  @  some more exciting     
                prose 
T/</pre>
<p>and after reflow:</p>
<pre>/TM TABLE(TOP:'-' WIDTH:40 SIDE:'|') COL(B:'-' S:'|') 2(A:R W:12)
  ----------------------------------------
  |cell one |    cell two|now is the time|
  |         |            |for all good   |
  |         |            |parties to end |
  ----------------------------------------
  |row 2    |           @|some more      |
  |cell     |            |exciting       |
  |prose    |            |               |
  ----------------------------------------
T/</pre>
<p>You can omit the contents of empty cells on the right end of a row. However, you cannot leave blank a cell or cells on any line within a row, or PPQT will assign
text to the wrong column (as in the example above where "prose" fell
from column 3 to column 1 because columns 1 and 2 were blank).
To fill in for a cell that is logically empty,
use a single @ character on every line, as in the above example.</p>
<p>PPQT assigns horizontal space to columns using some brain-dead heuristics.
To get exactly the spacing you want, specify the width of the table and
of each column individually.</p>
<p>As suggested by the example, you can spell out the names of properties,
for example <tt>WIDTH:50</tt> instead of <tt>W:50</tt>. (Actually, only
the initial letter is checked, so <tt>WATERMELON:50</tt> works, too.)</p>
<p>Decimal alignment makes the decimal separators line up vertically in a column. When you specify <tt>A:D</tt> for a column, you can also specify
the width in two parts, for example <tt>W:7.3</tt> where the first number (7)
says the minimum width for the integer part, and the second (3) sets the
minimum width for the decimal and the fraction digits. You may also
specify <tt>D:'<i>x</i>'</tt> to set a different decimal separator character <i>x</i>, for example in a European text where comma is the conventional
decimal "point". Here is a simple table with decimal alignment before reflow:</p>
<pre>
/T TABLE(WIDTH:30) 1(A:R) 2(A:D W:8.4 D:',')
Persimmons   &euro; 24,20
Marshmallows  &euro; 124,80
T/</pre>
<p>And after:</p>
<pre>
/T TABLE(WIDTH:30) 1(A:R) 2(A:D W:8.4 D:',')
    Persimmons        &euro; 24,20 
  Marshmallows       &euro; 124,80 
T/
</pre>
<p>Sadly, decimal alignment is not supported in HTML, and such cells are aligned left. Also, decimal alignment can produce odd results when applied to cells that contain text, especially in a multi-line table.</p>
<p>Getting a table to flow properly can be tedious. The first time you flow it, it is likely to have many errors, often because there are extra spaces that cause false column breaks, or missing spaces that cause column values to run together. But with work it is usually possible to get a table to look right. Post a sample of a recalcitrant table to the forum and ask for advice.</p>
<h3 id='html'>HTML Conversion</h3>
<p>ASCII reflow is designed so you can do it repeatedly. HTML conversion
is a one-shot deal that wipes out the reflow markup lines and the spacing
of tables. Select a range of text and click HTML Convert: Selection, or
click Convert: Document to do the whole thing. HTML conversion is a single
undo/redo operation: apply it; check the result in the <a href='#View'>Preview panel</a>; key ctl-z to undo and fix the markup.</p>
<p>During conversion the following changes are made
for the different markup types.</p>
<table border='1' style='width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;'>
<tr><th style='width:25%;'>Markup</th><th>Converted to:</th></tr>
<tr><td>text paragraphs</td><td><tt>&lt;p></tt><i>para text</i><tt>&lt;/p></tt></td></tr>

<tr><td>text in these</td><td>not touched</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>X/</b>, <b>C/</b>, <b>*/</b></td><td><tt>&lt;/pre></tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/T</b>, <b>/TM</b></td><td><tt>&lt;table></tt> or <tt>&lt;table style="width:<i>pp</i>%;"></tt> where <i>pp</i> is based on the indents and the specified table width.</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>T/</b></td><td><tt>&lt;/table></tt></td>
</table>
<p>Within a table, the cell values are enclosed appropriately in <tt>&lt;tr></tt> and <tt>&lt;td></tt> codes. Where a specific width was given for a column, the first row of that column is coded <tt>&lt;td style="width:<i>pp</i>%;"></tt> where
<i>pp</i> is based on the specified width divided by the table width.
When a column has right alignment or center alignment, every cell in it is 
coded with <tt>class="r"</tt> or <tt>class="c"</tt> respectively.
This assumes CSS of<pre>td.r {text-align:right}
td.c {text-align:center}</pre>
<p>Decimal alignment in a table could be coded in HTML as
<tt>&lt;td char='<i>x</i>'></tt> on each cell of a decimal column, but
this element of the HTML 4.0 standard is not supported by any browsers, so Decimal-aligned columns just default to left-alignment. Too bad.</p>
<h2 id='View'>The Preview Panel</h2>
<p>Click the Pvw tab to display the HTML Preview panel. Whenever
you click either Refresh button on this panel, the complete contents of the
Edit document are copied into this panel and displayed as HTML.</p>
<p>The default font is set to Palatino and the initial text font size is set to 16 points. When the focus is in the Preview panel, you can key ctl-minus and ctl-plus to zoom to smaller and larger text font sizes.</p>
<p>
The HTML rendering is done by the open-source <a href='http://www.webkit.org'>WebKit engine</a>, the same HTML rendering code that is used by Apple's Safari and by KDE. It fully supports CSS and
standard HTML code. Java and Javascript are disabled in the Preview panel, however.</p>
<p>The base URL for image references is the base path of the book text file,
so the <tt>images</tt> folder should be located at the same place as the book text.</p>
<p>If you click a link in the preview (for example, to open a high-resolution image)

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>The following terms are important. A <i>Note</i> is a section of text that begins with <tt>[Footnote</tt> and ends with a right-bracket, for example,</p>
<pre>[Footnote <b>z</b>: ... some text possibly mutiple lines,
ending with -- ]</pre>
<p>A Note is only recognized when  <tt>[Footnote</tt> begins in column zero  and the final right-bracket is the last character on its line. (Additional square brackets within a Note are not a problem so long as they don't come at the end of a line.) A Note may contain other types of markup, for example quotes, poems or tables.</p>
<p>An <i>Anchor</i> is a reference to a Note enclosed in brackets thus<tt>[<b>z</b>]</tt>. An Anchor is never found in column zero, although
it may come at the end of a line. Anchors may appear in tables, quotes, and poetry as well as normal text.
<p>A Note should not be coded inside /Q or /T or any other markup section that gets indented, because after reflow the <tt>[Footnote</tt> will no longer be at the left margin, and the note won't be recognized. When an Anchor appears in some markup section, place the matching Note after the end of the markup.</p>

A Note may  contain an Anchor to another Note (that is, a footnote to the footnote&mdash;yes, it really happens), but the Note bodies cannot be nested. The referenced Note to the Note must be outside the referring Note, perhaps immediately after it.</p>
<p>A <i>Key</i> is the bit of text that relates an Anchor to its Note, <tt><b>z</b></tt> in these examples. A key falls into one of several <i>Classes</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The letters <tt>IVXLCD</tt> are in the Upper Roman class</li>
<li>The letters <tt>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</tt> are Upper Alpha Class</li>
<li>The letters <tt>ivxlcd</tt> are Lower Roman class</li>
<li>The letters <tt>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</tt> are Lower Alpha Class</li>
<li>The digits <tt>0123456789</tt> are Decimal Class</li>
<li>The six symbols <tt>*&curren;&sect;&para;&dagger;&Dagger;</tt> (asterisk, currency, section, paragraph, dagger and double-dagger) are Symbol Class</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the Latin alphabet, digits, and the symbols shown are recognized as Key values. (Most PGDP books are proofed using only the letters A, B and occasionally C; some scholarly books might have lowercase roman keys or decimal keys as well.)</p>
<p>The alphabetic classes are ambiguous; that is, a letter Key might be either
an alpha or a roman, depending on how you want your book to work. This is
resolved when renumbering, see below.</p>
<h3>The Footnote Table</h3>
<p>When you click the Refresh button at the top of the panel, PPQT scans the document for Anchors and Notes. It matches the anchors and notes and displays the result in the table. The columns of the table are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Key</b>: the letters or numbers of the key.</li>
<li><b>Class</b>: the Key Class that PPQT has assigned based on the Key.</li>
<li><b>Ref Line</b>: the line number where the Anchor was seen.</li>
<li><b>Note Line</b>: the first line number of the Note.</li>
<li><b>Length</b>: the number of lines in the Note.</li>
<li><b>Text</b>: the first few characters of the Note text.</li>
</ul>
<p>When PPQT finds an Anchor but cannot match it to a Note, the Note Line column has a question mark. When it found a Note but no Anchor refers to it, the Ref Line column has a question mark. In these unmatched cases, the row of the table is pink to show there is a problem. You must resolve these problems before the action buttons at the bottom of the panel will work.</p>
<p>When a Note has more than 10 text lines, or an Anchor is more than 50 lines from its Note, the table row is pale green to suggest a possible problem. You should check these cases to make sure PPQT has recognized the Note properly and matched it to the correct Anchor.</p>
<p>When you click on a Ref Line cell, the document jumps to the line with that Anchor, with the Key selected. Click on a Note Line cell; the document jumps to that Note with the Note selected. Click repeatedly on a Key cell and the document jumps back and forth between the Anchor and the Note.</p>
<h3>Renumbering</h3>
<p>When you click the Renumber button, provided there are no pink lines in the table, PPQT sweeps through all the Keys in the document and renumbers them sequentially according to their Class. PPQT has five counters that are set to zero when you click Renumber, and that are increased by 1 each time they are used. The number streams are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1,2,..999</b> produces a series of decimal numbers.</li>
<li><b>A,B,..ZZ</b> produces a series of uppercase letters.</li>
<li><b>a,b,..zz</b> produces a series of lowercase letters.</li>
<li><b>I,II,..M</b> produces a series of uppercase Roman numerals.</li>
<li><b>i,ii,..m</b> produces a series of lowercase Roman numerals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below the table are six popup menus that let you specify how the Keys of each Class are to be renumbered. If the book has only uppercase alpha keys (the usual situation) then set Classes ABC and IVX both to use the A,B..ZZ stream.
However, if the book has a separate set of lowercase Roman keys, set that Class
to use the i,ii,..m stream. You could also use renumbering to change the Class of keys in use. If the book has only uppercase alpha, you could set that Class to use the 1,2,..999 stream; after renumbering, those keys will be Decimal class.</p>
<p>Renumbering is a single-undo operation. After renumbering, examine the results; if they are not satisfactory, click in the text and key ctl-z.</p>
<h3>Footnote Sections and Moving Footnotes</h3>
<p>Proofers leave Notes on the page where they appear. You move them to follow the paragraph that references them. However for some books you want to move all Notes to a special section at the end of each chapter, or at the end of the book.</p>
<p>To do this, you must edit the book to show where the footnotes are to go using the markup codes <tt>/F</tt> and <tt>F/</tt>. For example, a section of notes at the end of a chapter might be coded:</p>
<pre>...last line of chapter text.


NOTES


/F
F/</pre><p>Here, <tt>NOTES</tt> represents a subhead (because it is preceded and followed by two blank lines). The text "NOTES" does not matter; it is the <tt>/F..F/</tt> markup codes that tell where the Notes from the preceding chapter should be moved. Alternatively you might have a single chapter of notes at the end of the book text.</p>
<p>When you click the Move Notes button, PPQT scans the document and locates all the <tt>/F..F/</tt> sections you have coded. (If it cannot find any, it displays an error.) Then it goes through the footnote table and finds any Notes that are not already enclosed in a <tt>/F..F/</tt> section. It moves these into the Footnote section next below them in the document. (If there is no section below  a Note, it is not moved.)</p>
<p>Moving notes is a single-undo operation. Inspect the result and use ctl-z if it is not satisfactory.</p>
<h3>ASCII Conversion</h3>
<p>Click ASCII Cvt in the Footnote Panel to convert all Notes to block-quote /Q..Q/ markup. Each note is changed from:<pre>
[Footnote key: Text of the note... ]</pre> into:<pre>/Q F:2 L:<i>w</i> R:2
  [key] Text of the note...
Q/</pre>The left-indent <i>w</i> is based on the widest key of that key class.
These new /Q..Q/ sections can be reflowed in the <a href='#Flow'>Reflow Panel</a> ASCII reflow.
</p>
<p>Do this as the very last footnote operation in the plain text fork of the book. Afterward, the Footnote Panel is of no use because the Notes can no
longer be recognized.</p>
 
<h3>HTML Conversion</h3>
<p>HTML conversion of footnotes is divided between the Footnote Panel and the Reflow Panel.</p>
<p>In the Footnote panel click HTML Cvt to convert all Anchors and Notes to HTML. This is a single-undo operation. Do this as the very last footnote operation in the HTML fork of the book. Afterward, the Footnote Panel is of no use, because the Notes can no longer be recognized.</p>
<p>This does not convert the the markup tags <tt>/F..F/</tt>. Later, when you use HTML Convert in the <a href='#html'>Reflow Panel</a>, it converts the tags to <tt>&lt;div></tt> markup.</p>
<h2 id='Extras'>The Extras Folder</h2>
<p>
Within the distribution folder <tt>PPQT</tt> there is a folder named <tt>extras</tt> with some miscellaneous documents:</p>
<li><tt>en-common.txt</tt> is the file of common English scannos, pretty much the same as that distributed with Guiguts.</li>
<li><tt>suggested-workflow.rtf</tt> describes the steps of post-proofing with PPQT in a logical sequence.</li>
<li><tt>empty-buttons.utf</tt> is a Find Buttons file that will clear all 24 buttons to <tt>(empty)</tt> status. Use it before setting up your own buttons to save, so as to avoid saving superfluous definitions.</li>
<li><tt>unbalancedRE.utf</tt> loads a set of Find buttons to look for unbalanced markup.</li>
<li><tt>fixupRE.utf</tt> loads a set of Find buttons to look for common formatting errors, modelled after Guiguts Fixup.</li>
<li><tt>find-psep.utf</tt> loads a set of Find buttons to find and delete page separators.</li>
<li><tt>clearTextMarkups.utf</tt> loads a set of Find buttons to find and delete block markup.</li>
<li><tt>htmlFixes.utf</tt> loads Find buttons to convert small-cap text,
superscripts, subscripts, Side notes, Illustrations, and typo markups to HTML.</li>
<li><tt>syntax-of-find-button-files.txt</tt> has sketchy documentation of the format of a Find button file.</li>
<li><tt>header.html</tt> contains the opening of an HTML etext including the <tt>&lt;!DOCTYPE></tt> and<tt>&lt;head></tt> statements and the full CSS style section described in the PGDP Wiki under "CSS Cookbook" (but with some classnames modified to match what PPQT generates).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='OldNew'>What Was New</h2>
<h3>What's New as of 10 December 2012</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clicking one of the Replace buttons in the Find panel (or using ctl-= or ctl-t in the edit panel, which are the same) will only do the replace if the current selection was created by a find. If the selection has changed since a find was last done, the replace is not done and PPQT beeps.</li>
<li>When you double-click a character in the Chars panel, or a word 
in the Words panel, PPQT does a find-first for that character or word as before,
but it does not make the Find panel visible. You still see the Chars or Words
panel.</li>
<li>Also, the Respect Case switch is set for these searches, and the
Whole Word switch is set for a Word search.</li>
<li>The File menu shortcuts for Open, New etc. now work as soon as the
program starts up, without having to display the File menu once.</li>
<li>The keyboard shortcuts for the various panels have been removed because they potentially or actually conflict with standard menu shortcuts. Panels can only be displayed by clicking on their tabs.</li>
<li>The find buttons in extras/unbalancedRE.utf have been extended to find some more cases of unbalanced markup. However they can't find everything, see the notes in the file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's New as of 4 December 2012</h3>
<p>A number of small fixes thanks to input from users julo and Bibimbop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected the label of the zoom slider on the Pngs panel.</li>
<li>Cleared the default filename from the Save Find Buttons dialog to reduce the chance of saving over the document(!).</li>
<li>Moved the line number field to the left of the status bar.</li>
<li>Fixed ctl-s and ctl-shift-s to work as shortcuts for File>Save and Save-As in Ubuntu and Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed the previous-strings popups in Find and Replace to work correctly on Windows, and to not show a scrap of a character on Ubuntu.</li>
<li>On ctl-f when focus goes to the Find panel, the Find text is all-selected so it is easy to type a new find string.</li>
<li>The View > Dictionary dialog presents dictionary names in sorted order and with the current dictionary selected.</li>
<li>Proper CRLF line-ends written on Windows.</li>
<li>The document-modified indicator turns on more reliably in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's New in 1.01.01 (6 Nov. 2012)</h3>
<p>The Edit > Titlecase command now operates correctly when the selected words are uppercase or mixed-case.</p>
<p>The Pngs panel now features new zoom controls, see <a href='#Pngs'>The Pngs Panel</a> below.</p>
<h3>What's New in 1.01 (24 Oct. 2012)</h3>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you select a font with the View > Font... dialog the font size you
pick is remembered for the next session.</li>
<li>When you place the edit cursor above the text of the first page,
the Pngs panel shows the gray "No Image" image instead of showing
the image of the last page.</li>
<li>Zooming in and out with ctl-plus and ctl-minus (supported in the
Edit, Notes, Pngs, Preview and Help panels) works with keys on the keypad as well as on the main keyboard.</li>
 <li>When you load a different file of scannos, the hiliting of the words
 from the previous scanno file is cleared out.</li>
 <li>The save-needed status in the title bar changes correctly as changes occur in the notes and other metadata, as well as with changes in the document.</li>
 <li>PPQT now remembers whether a census of words and characters or a spellcheck is needed over save/load. If you change the text or the good-words
 list and save the file, when you next load it and click Refresh, the
 census and spellcheck are done.</li>
</ul>
<p>New or changed function:</p>
<ul>
<li>There have been major changes in how the encoding for an input file is chosen, and a new command has been added to the File menu: Open With Encoding. See the <a href='#Encodings'>File Encodings</a> topic below.</li>
<li>When a single word is selected in the Edit panel, the standard <a href='#ContextMenu'>context menu</a> has an option to add that word to the good-words list.</li>
<li>When the keyboard focus is in the <a href='#Words'>Words panel</a> and the table is sorted ascending on column 0, keying a letter jumps to the approximate position of words beginning with that letter.</li>
<li>Holding the shift key when going to a bookmark causes the current selection to be extended to the bookmark location.</li>
</ul>
