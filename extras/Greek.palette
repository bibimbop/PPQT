              FORMAT OF A PALETTE FILE
A palette file specifies the values of each of 36 keys in the palette.
The file suffix is .palette. Any file with the suffix .palette found
in the "extras" folder of the PPQT folder is opened, made into a palette,
and added to the Edit > Palettes submenu.

The file NAME becomes the name of the palette in the Edit > Palettes
submenu. The palette window title is "NAME Text Entry".
This file is Greek.palette, so it appears as Edit > Palettes > Greek
and its window title is "Greek Text Entry".

A palette file is always opened as UTF-8.

The real data in a palette file are in 3-item comma-separated variable (CSV)
lines. Any line that does not appear to be a 3-item CSV line (i.e. all this
blah-blah commentary) is just ignored.

The three items are as follows:
1. A single-letter key, A-Z or 0-9. This specifies which of the 36
   keytop buttons is being set.
2. A combination of the letters ACLU (or UCLA if you are a Trojan).
   These specify the shift-state for this value.
   L = lower case or unshifted
   U = uppercase or upshifted
   C = control (or command) key is down
   A = alt (or option) key is down
   There are 8 possible shift states, so each key can potentially
   have up to 8 values.
3. A sequence of one or more Unicode characters, which is the value
   to be entered by this key in this shift state.

The Unicode sequence can take any of three forms.
a. One to five decimal digits, specifying the numeric value of on
   character, for example 928 for a Greek Capital Pi.
b. One to five Unicode characters, the literal value for the key.
   Allowing more than one lets you include a letter and up to four
   combining diacriticals.
c. The character string name of a Unicode character.

Avoid assigning any value to control-Q, because that combination is
trapped by the system and means "Quit". Control-W may cause a problem
if it means "close window" in this platform.

It is possible to assign values to other standard keys like ^C (Copy).
The value is entered before the key is acted on for its standard meaning.

                     ------------------

Here is the Greek palette. The letter keys provide "Modern Greek" letters:
* the shift key controls lowercase and uppercase
* the control key adds the Tonos where appropriate
* the alt key adds the Dialytika (diaresis) where appropriate
* control + alt add Tonos + Dialytika where appropriate
"Where appropriate" means, there exists a Unicode character for that combo.

All diacritics are on the digit keys. Any combination can be created
by typing first the upper- or lower-case letter then some combination
of diacritics, followed by the Tab key to do NFC normalization.

All diacritics on the numerics. No idea what a good sequence would be.
Most common should be mode L, others U, but have no info on frequency.
NOTE: the unicode "normalization" routines will only compress from, and
decompress into, "combining" forms. Thus Greek Tonos won't "normalize" with
any other letter, but "combining acute accent" will. There is no unicode
"greek combining dialytika" but "combining diaresis" is the same.

The following are the equivalents produced when you de-normalize
a Greek letter: if it contains this it decomposes to -> that
  VARIA -> COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT (300)
  OXIA OR TONOS!  -> COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (301)
  MACRON -> COMBINING MACRON (304)
  VRACHI -> COMBINING BREVE (306)
  DIALYTIKA -> COMBINING DIAERESIS (308)
  PSILI -> COMBINING COMMA ABOVE (313)
  DASIA -> COMBINING REVERSED COMMA ABOVE (314)
  PERISPOMENI -> COMBINING GREEK PERISPOMENI (342)
  KORONIS -> COMBINING GREEK KORONIS (343)
  -GEGRAMMENI -> COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI (345) (both ypo- and pro-)
plus one combo, COMBINING GREEK DIALYTIKA TONOS
